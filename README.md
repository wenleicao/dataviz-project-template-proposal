# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is Massachusetts Crime dataset
you can download the original file [here](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/table-6/table-6-state-cuts/massachusetts.xls/output.xls)

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Massachusett community type  (map chart)
 * how crime are distributed across Massachusett? (map chart, total crime count, color  based on number)
 * how crime are distributed after weighted by population?  (using total crime count/ population,  color based on number)
 * 100% stacked column chart show crime difference between different commnity type.
 * Scatter chart between population and crime number, color by city
 * interactive chart, when choose area, community type, top 3 /botton 3 city show on the map (this will help people make decision)

## Sketches
The following is the sketches I created. 
[![image](https://wenleicao/wenleicao.github.io/images/data_visualization/sketch.PNG)]

Left 1 chart, create massachusetts geoshape and map it to its county. This set a stage for later visualization
left 2 chart,  total crime distribuation in different city
left 3 chart,  total crime count/population in different city (this will eliminate population factor)
right 1 chart,  different communtiy (city, suburb and rural differnece vs differnt type of crime )
right 2 chart,  Scatter chart, can compare between cities, same level of population, how high the crime count is.
right 3 chart,  linked chart, user can choose county and communtiy type to choose upper 3 or bottom 3 crime count city. 


## Open Questions
I have not loaded Massachusetts map yet. that is a challenge ahead.  the other challenge how to map city and county to the map
